## [NeuroLog Website](https://elegant-archimedes-c68a8e.netlify.app)

**NeuroLog** is a react build which shows users a database of neuroscience-related research articles. Users will be able to view current research, add new articles, and delete them. It will have a second Airtable with a popular news section geared towards less science-inclined users. As a PMVP I will possibly add an external API with a larger databsse of journal articles, a voting system for the article/news list pages, and the delete button will also require a password.
